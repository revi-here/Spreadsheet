***Conclusion***  
- The above graphs show that the users are more active in weekends than weekdays. 

## Effectiveness of referral program  
### Active months  
![Active months](images/active.png 'Active months')   
- Members in general are active for 2.5 to 3 months on an average.

We don’t see any significant difference with members who were referred irrespective of whatever area you look into - program, groups, join date, active months.  

## 2.Analyze where the members are coming from , visualization using a map, heatmap, etc. of where the membership is.
